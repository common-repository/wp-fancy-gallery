Image Gallery + Photo Gallery + Portfolio Gallery + Title + Description + Tiled Gallery in 1 plugin.

== Description ==

This neat little plugin is based on FancyBox and FreeWall plugins and allows simple creation of galleries with thumbnails, popups and descriptions for each image. Thus said, there will be a small thumbnail in the text, which will turn into a HD pop-up upon clicking, therefore allowing you to insert large quantities of visual content that will be packed into compact galleries within your posts. These galleries can be inserted at any point in your post using a simple WYSIWYG (HTML) editor.

This gallery plugin is perfect for you if you need:

* wedding album photo gallery
* designer portfolio photo gallery
* photographer's portfolio photo gallery
* product showcase photo gallery
